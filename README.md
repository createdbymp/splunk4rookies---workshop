# Splunk4Rookies - Hands On Workshop

## Introduction

Splunk presented a workshop to the public, highlighting the power of their platform with key SPL (Search Processing Language) searches. The session showcased several important searches:

1. **Customer Locations Search:** Identified customer IPs and geolocated them to cities outside the United States.
2. **Lost Revenue Search:** Calculated lost revenue from failed purchase attempts.
3. **Web Browser Failures Search:** Counted and charted web browsers with the most access failures.
4. **Popular Operating Systems Search:** Listed the top 10 operating systems from access logs.
5. **Web Server Status Codes Search:** Tracked web server status codes over time.

These examples provided just a glimpse of what Splunk has to offer, demonstrating how it can turn data into valuable insights for enhanced decision-making and operational efficiency.
